*DESCRIPTION*: For this project, I used **Power BI Desktop** to create an interactive sales dashboard that visualizes sales trends, top-selling products, and time-based performance using a pizza sales dataset. The data was cleaned and transformed using **Power Query Editor**, where I handled tasks such as removing duplicates, fixing data types, and creating new time-based columns (like time of day and day of week). I established relationships between tables like `orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types` for accurate data modeling. Using **DAX formulas**, I created measures for total sales, most ordered pizza, and top revenue-generating products. The dashboard includes various visuals such as bar charts, column charts, pie charts, and KPI cards, along with **interactive slicers** that allow users to filter by category, date, or time. The final deliverable is a Power BI (.PBIX) file containing clean data, dynamic visuals, and user-friendly features for insights-driven exploration.
